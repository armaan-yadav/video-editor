# Local Video Rendering Setup

## Changes Made

I've successfully converted your video editor from using Remotion AWS Lambda (cloud rendering) to local rendering using `@remotion/renderer`. Here's what was changed:

## 1. New Files Created

### `remotion/Root.tsx`
- Main Remotion entry point that registers the video composition
- Used by the bundler to create the rendering bundle

### `remotion/Composition.tsx`
- Wraps your existing editor composition for rendering
- Receives the design data as props and passes it to the player composition

## 2. Modified Files

### `src/app/api/render/route.ts`
**Before:** Made API calls to cloud service (api.designcombo.dev)
**After:** 
- Uses `@remotion/bundler` to bundle the Remotion project
- Uses `@remotion/renderer` to render videos locally
- Creates an in-memory job queue to track render progress
- Saves rendered videos to `public/renders/` directory

Key changes:
- Added `bundle()` to bundle the Remotion composition
- Added `selectComposition()` to get composition details
- Added `renderMedia()` to render the video
- Progress tracking from 0-100%
- Videos saved as `public/renders/{renderId}.mp4`

### `src/app/api/render/[id]/route.ts`
**Before:** Fetched status from cloud API
**After:** 
- Checks local render job status from in-memory Map
- Returns progress, status, and video URL when complete
- Compatible with existing frontend polling mechanism

### `package.json`
- Added `@remotion/bundler` dependency

## 3. How It Works

1. **User clicks export**
   - Frontend calls `POST /api/render` with design data
   - Server creates a unique render ID and starts rendering in background
   - Immediately returns the render ID to the frontend

2. **Rendering Process**
   - Bundles the Remotion project (30% progress)
   - Selects the composition with design props (40% progress)
   - Renders the video frame-by-frame (40-95% progress)
   - Saves to `public/renders/{renderId}.mp4` (100% progress)

3. **Status Checking**
   - Frontend polls `GET /api/render/{renderId}`
   - Returns current status: PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED
   - When complete, returns the video URL

## 4. Installation Steps

Run this command to install the new dependency:

```bash
pnpm install @remotion/bundler
```

Or if pnpm isn't working in bash, use PowerShell or CMD:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\armaa\Desktop\red\designcombo
pnpm install
```

## 5. Benefits of Local Rendering

✅ **No Cloud Costs:** No AWS Lambda or API fees
✅ **Full Control:** Render videos on your own hardware
✅ **Privacy:** Design data stays on your server
✅ **Customization:** Easy to modify rendering settings
✅ **No API Limits:** Render as many videos as your server can handle

## 6. Considerations

⚠️ **Server Resources:** Video rendering is CPU-intensive
⚠️ **Blocking:** Renders happen sequentially (can be improved with queues)
⚠️ **Storage:** Videos are saved to disk (consider cleanup strategy)
⚠️ **Production:** For production, consider:
  - Using a proper job queue (Bull, BullMQ)
  - Storing videos in cloud storage (S3, etc.)
  - Adding file cleanup after download
  - Implementing render timeouts
  - Adding concurrent render limits

## 7. Next Steps

1. Install the dependency: `pnpm install`
2. Create the `public/renders` directory if it doesn't exist
3. Start your dev server: `pnpm dev`
4. Test the rendering by exporting a video from the editor
5. Check `public/renders/` for the output file

## 8. Configuration Options

You can customize the rendering by modifying `src/app/api/render/route.ts`:

- **Video codec:** Change `codec: "h264"` to other formats
- **Output format:** Change `.mp4` to other extensions
- **Quality settings:** Add `quality` parameter to `renderMedia()`
- **Concurrency:** Implement parallel rendering with worker threads

## 9. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Bundling fails:** Check that `remotion/Root.tsx` exists and imports are correct
2. **Render fails:** Check console logs for detailed error messages
3. **Video not found:** Verify `public/renders/` directory exists
4. **Slow rendering:** This is normal for local rendering, depends on video length and server specs

## 10. Environment Variables

You may want to add to `.env`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

This is used to construct the full video URL in the response.
