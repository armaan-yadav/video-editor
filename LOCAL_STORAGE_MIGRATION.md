# Local-Only Asset Storage - Summary

## What Changed

### ✅ Removed Cloud Dependencies
- ❌ External upload service (`upload-file-j43uyuaeza-uc.a.run.app`)
- ❌ Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
- ❌ Presigned URL generation for cloud uploads
- ✅ All assets stored locally in `public/` directory

### ✅ Local Storage Implementation

#### Upload Endpoints
- **`/api/uploads/presign`** - Generates local file paths (no longer calls external service)
- **`/api/uploads/local`** - Handles direct file uploads to local filesystem
- **`/api/uploads/url`** - Downloads external URLs and saves locally

#### Storage Locations
```
public/
├── user-uploads/       # All user-uploaded assets
│   ├── images/        # (organized by nanoid)
│   ├── videos/
│   └── audio/
└── renders/           # Rendered video outputs
```

## File Flow

### 1. Direct File Upload
```
User selects file
    ↓
POST /api/uploads/presign (gets local path)
    ↓
PUT /api/uploads/local (saves to filesystem)
    ↓
File stored in public/user-uploads/
    ↓
Available at /user-uploads/{fileId}.{ext}
```

### 2. URL-based Upload (Pexels, etc.)
```
User selects image/video from Pexels
    ↓
POST /api/uploads/url (downloads from external URL)
    ↓
File saved to public/user-uploads/
    ↓
Available at /user-uploads/{fileId}.{ext}
```

### 3. Video Rendering
```
User clicks render
    ↓
POST /api/render (bundles & renders locally)
    ↓
Video saved to public/renders/
    ↓
Available at /renders/{renderId}.mp4
```

## Benefits

### 🚀 Performance

- Faster upload/download times

### 💰 Cost
- Zero cloud storage fees
- No API usage costs
- No bandwidth charges

### 🔒 Privacy
- All data stays on your machine
- No third-party services
- Complete control over assets

### 🛠️ Development
- Simpler setup (no cloud credentials)
- Easier debugging
- Offline development possible

## Trade-offs

### ⚠️ Considerations

1. **Disk Space**
   - Files accumulate on local disk
   - Need manual cleanup or automation
   - Monitor disk usage

2. **Scalability**
   - Single-machine storage
   - Not suitable for multi-user production
   - Consider cloud storage for production

3. **Backup**
   - Manual backup required
   - Not automatically redundant
   - Important: backup `public/user-uploads/` regularly

4. **Sharing**
   - Files only accessible on local machine
   - Cannot share links to others
   - Need deployment for public access

## Production Considerations

### For Production Deployment

If you deploy this application, consider:

1. **Persistent Storage**
   - Use volume mounts for `public/user-uploads/`
   - Use volume mounts for `public/renders/`
   - Ensure storage persists across deployments

2. **Backup Strategy**
   - Regular automated backups
   - Offsite backup storage
   - Version control for important assets

3. **Cleanup Jobs**
   - Schedule periodic cleanup of old uploads
   - Remove temporary files
   - Archive old renders

4. **Monitoring**
   - Track disk space usage
   - Alert on low disk space
   - Monitor upload sizes

### Example Docker Volumes
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./public/user-uploads:/app/public/user-uploads
  - ./public/renders:/app/public/renders
```

## Files Modified

### API Routes
- ✅ `src/app/api/uploads/presign/route.ts` - Local path generation
- ✅ `src/app/api/uploads/local/route.ts` - New local upload handler
- ✅ `src/app/api/uploads/url/route.ts` - Download & save locally
- ✅ `src/app/api/render/[id]/route.ts` - Return local URLs

### Upload Service
- ✅ `src/utils/upload-service.ts` - Works with new local endpoints

### Configuration
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Ignore uploaded files
- ✅ `public/user-uploads/.gitkeep` - Preserve directory
- ✅ `public/renders/.gitkeep` - Preserve directory

## Testing

### Test File Upload
1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Upload an image through UI
3. Check `public/user-uploads/` directory
4. Verify file is accessible at `/user-uploads/{fileId}.{ext}`

### Test URL Upload
1. Use Pexels integration to select an image
2. Image should download and save locally
3. Check `public/user-uploads/` for saved file

### Test Video Rendering
1. Create a composition
2. Click render
3. Check `public/renders/` for output video
4. Verify video plays correctly

## Cleanup Script (Optional)

Create a cleanup script to remove old files:

```javascript
// scripts/cleanup-uploads.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const uploadsDir = path.join(__dirname, '../public/user-uploads');
const maxAge = 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 30 days

fs.readdirSync(uploadsDir).forEach(file => {
  const filePath = path.join(uploadsDir, file);
  const stats = fs.statSync(filePath);
  
  if (Date.now() - stats.mtimeMs > maxAge) {
    fs.unlinkSync(filePath);
    console.log(`Deleted old file: ${file}`);
  }
});
```

Run with: `node scripts/cleanup-uploads.js`

## Summary

✅ **Cloud upload completely removed**
✅ **All assets stored locally**
✅ **Simpler architecture**
✅ **No external dependencies**
✅ **Full control over data**

The application now operates entirely with local storage, making it perfect for development, personal use, and single-user deployments.
