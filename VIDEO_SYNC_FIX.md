# Fix: Video Rendering Synchronization Issues

## Problems Fixed

1. **Timeline Mismatch** - Video length didn't match actual timeline
2. **Missing Elements** - Not all elements were being rendered
3. **Store Initialization** - Zustand store wasn't properly initialized during rendering

## Root Causes

### 1. Fixed Duration/FPS in Root.tsx
The `Root.tsx` had hardcoded values:
- `durationInFrames={300}` (always 10 seconds at 30fps)
- `fps={30}` (fixed)
- `width={1920}`, `height={1080}` (fixed)

This didn't respect the actual design's duration, fps, or dimensions.

### 2. Store Not Initialized Before Render
The `Composition.tsx` used `useEffect` to initialize the store, which runs AFTER the first render. This meant the composition rendered with empty data initially.

### 3. Design Data Not Passed Through
The Root component didn't accept or use the `design` inputProps, so the actual project data never reached the composition.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Dynamic Root.tsx ✅
Updated `remotion/Root.tsx` to:
- Accept `design` as inputProps
- Calculate dynamic `durationInFrames` from `design.duration` and `design.fps`
- Use actual width/height from `design.size`
- Pass design data to composition via `defaultProps`

```tsx
const fps = design?.fps || 30;
const duration = design?.duration || 5000;
const durationInFrames = Math.max(1, Math.ceil((duration / 1000) * fps));
```

### 2. Synchronous Store Initialization ✅
Updated `remotion/Composition.tsx` to:
- Use `useLayoutEffect` instead of `useEffect` (runs before render)
- Use `delayRender()` and `continueRender()` to pause rendering until store is ready
- Call `useStore.getState()` to get direct store access
- Initialize all necessary state fields synchronously

```tsx
const [handle] = useState(() => delayRender());
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  const store = useStore.getState();
  store.setState({ ...designData });
  continueRender(handle);
}, []);
```

### 3. Complete Design Data Mapping ✅
Ensured ALL design properties are passed to the store:
- `trackItemIds` - Order of items on timeline
- `trackItemsMap` - Full item data (text, images, videos, etc.)
- `size` - Canvas dimensions
- `fps` - Frame rate
- `duration` - Total duration in milliseconds
- `transitionsMap` - Transitions between items
- `structure` - Scene structure
- `background` - Background color/image
- `tracks` - Track data
- `transitionIds` - Transition IDs

## Testing

Try rendering again - the video should now:
- ✅ Match the exact timeline duration
- ✅ Include all elements from your editor
- ✅ Respect custom FPS settings
- ✅ Use correct canvas dimensions
- ✅ Apply all transitions properly
- ✅ Show correct background

## Verification

Check these in your rendered video:
1. Video duration matches what you see in the editor
2. All text, images, and other elements appear
3. Elements appear at the correct times
4. Transitions work between elements
5. Background color/image is correct
6. Canvas dimensions match your project settings
