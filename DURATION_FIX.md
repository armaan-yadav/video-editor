# Fix: Duration Mismatch Between design.duration and Actual Timeline

## Problem
The `design.duration` property didn't match the actual length of content on the timeline, causing videos to be cut short or have extra blank time at the end.

## Root Cause
The `design.duration` might be:
1. Not updated when timeline items are added/removed
2. Set to a default/initial value
3. Out of sync with the actual track items on the timeline

## Solution
Calculate the **actual duration** from the track items instead of relying solely on `design.duration`.

### Algorithm
```typescript
// Find the maximum end time across all track items
const maxEndTime = Math.max(
  ...Object.values(trackItemsMap).map((item) => {
    const start = item.display?.from || 0;
    const duration = item.display?.to ? 
      item.display.to - start : 
      item.details?.duration || 0;
    return start + duration;
  })
);
```

This calculates:
1. Each item's start time (`display.from`)
2. Each item's duration (either `display.to - display.from` or `details.duration`)
3. Each item's end time (`start + duration`)
4. Returns the maximum end time = actual timeline duration

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/app/api/render/route.ts` ✅
- Added duration calculation from `trackItemsMap`
- Falls back to `design.duration` if no track items exist
- Logs both calculated and original duration for debugging

### 2. Updated `remotion/Root.tsx` ✅
- Same calculation logic applied
- Ensures Composition registration uses correct duration
- Prevents duration mismatch between render call and composition

## Benefits
- ✅ Video length exactly matches timeline content
- ✅ No premature cuts
- ✅ No extra blank frames at the end
- ✅ Works even if `design.duration` is not updated

## Testing
Try rendering a video and check:
1. Console logs show: `Calculated duration from track items: {ms}ms`
2. Rendered video length matches your timeline
3. Last element appears completely (not cut off)
4. No blank frames after last element

## Debugging
If duration is still wrong, check the console logs:
```
[Render] Calculated duration from track items: 15000ms
[Render] Duration: 15000ms (design.duration: 10000), FPS: 30, Frames: 450
```

This shows:
- Calculated duration from items: 15000ms (15 seconds)
- Original design.duration: 10000ms (10 seconds)
- Final frames: 450 (15 seconds × 30 fps)
